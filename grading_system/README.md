Project Idea: Student Grading System
Objective:
Design and implement a simple student grading system that allows instructors to input grades for students and perform various operations like calculating averages, determining grades based on criteria, and displaying results.

Topics Covered:

Variables and Arithmetic Operations:

Use variables to store student information such as names, IDs, and grades.
Perform arithmetic operations to calculate averages and other statistical measures.
Conditional Statements:

Use conditional statements (if, else if, else) to determine grade ranges (e.g., A, B, C) based on numerical scores.
Switch Statements:

Implement switch statements to handle menu-driven operations, such as selecting different functionalities of the grading system (e.g., input grades, display results).
Character Input/Output:

Use character input/output functions (printf, scanf) to interact with the user and display information.
Loops/Nested Loops, Break, and Continue:

Utilize loops (while, for) to repeatedly input grades for multiple students until a termination condition (e.g., entering a specific character).
Use nested loops to navigate through different options or functionalities within the system.
Employ break and continue statements to control flow within loops based on certain conditions (e.g., exit a loop on user command).
Operators:

Employ various operators (+, -, *, /, %, relational, logical) to perform calculations and comparisons in the grading system.
Conditional Expressions:

Use conditional expressions (ternary operator) where appropriate to streamline code and improve readability.
Functional Requirements:

Input student names, IDs, and grades.
Calculate averages, maximum and minimum grades.
Determine letter grades based on numerical scores.
Display individual student results and overall statistics (e.g., class average).
Menu-driven interface using switch statements to select different functionalities.
Handle edge cases such as invalid input (e.g., non-numeric grades).
Implementation Steps:

Define structures or arrays to store student information (name, ID, grades).
Implement functions to input student data, calculate averages, determine grades, and display results.
Use conditional statements to implement grade determination logic (e.g., if-else ladder for grade ranges).
Implement a menu-driven interface using switch statements to allow users to navigate through different functionalities.
Test the system with sample input data to ensure correct operation and handle any potential errors or edge cases.
